Box2D is a contuously evolving engine, and experimental features are constantly being added.

Sometimes this has the consequence that code is removed despite offering advantages in some cases, or different behaviour. I'm creating LegacyBox2D as a sort of graveyard for useful pieces of functionality that didn't make the cut.

Consider this area for advanced users only. It's good for development for example, by replacing components of Box2D, you can isolate bugs easier.
